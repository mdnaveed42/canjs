## File Navigator

The [guides/recipes/file-navigator-simple] walks through building a simple navigation
widget where you can open and close folders.

The [guides/recipes/file-navigator-advanced] walks through a navigation widget that uses
[can-connect] to load the data for a folder from a simulated service layer.

## TodoMVC with StealJS

The [guides/recipes/todomvc-with-steal] guide builds the TodoMVC application, like the [guides/todomvc], but using [StealJS](https://stealjs.com) to load modules.  It is designed to be done in a classroom-like setting and includes links
to keynote and powerpoint presentations for each section.


## Weather Report

The [guides/recipes/weather-report-simple] walks through building a 10 day forecast widget
using YQL. The [guides/recipes/weather-report-advanced] extends the simple widget to
remove imperative code and automatically lookup the users location using the
browser's [geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) with
event streams.
